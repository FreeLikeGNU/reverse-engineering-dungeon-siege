## NOTES

Files in this directory are copyrighted by Gas Powered Games (GPG).
These files are made available by Scott Bilas in his [website][1]
and I've saved a copy of the interesting ones here for quick reference
when needed.

These files are not part of this project nor are being compiled into
the generated binaries.

`siege_max/` subdirectory contains the *GMax* import/export scripts used
to generate the 3D meshes used by the game from the 3D Max modeling tool.
I've based most of my importers on those scripts. The source of the "siege_max"
files was [SiegeTheDay.org][2]
