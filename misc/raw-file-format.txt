Dungeon Siege RAW texture format
----------------------------------

The RAW format (or simply Raw; not an initialism) is a bitmap format
used to store all the textures and sprites used by Dungeon Siege.
Raw textures are always stored inside Tank files.

This is a custom format, not directly related to other commercial
formats with the ".raw" filename extension.

The name comes from the fact that pixels are stored uncompressed (raw) in the file.
Raw textures can also contain the full set of mipmap surfaces.

File layout is:

Format: BINARY.
Byte order: LITTLE ENDIAN, but pixels are stores as BGRA DWORDs.

A Raw texture file starts with a tiny 16 bytes header that contains the dimensions
of the base surface (mipmap 0) and the number of surfaces/mipmaps. The dimensions
of subsequent mipmaps surfaces are calculated from that.

The first 8 bytes of the header are the 4CCs "ipaR" (or "Rapi" backwards) and "8888".

BGRA pixel data for surface 0 (the largest one) follows immediately. The next mipmap
surface follows where the first one ends, and so on for all the surface until the final 1x1 level.

The Raw format is very straightforward and was meant to be fast to load and pass
on to the rendering back-end. It was stored uncompressed because Tank files are
already compressed, so no point in compressing twice.

Look at the RapiRawReader.h provided by Scott Bilas <http://scottbilas.com/games/dungeon-siege/>
or our raw_image.hpp/.cpp implementation for the details. As you'd expect, there's nothing surprising about it.
