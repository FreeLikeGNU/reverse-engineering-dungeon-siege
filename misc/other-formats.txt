There are a number of other file formats used by Dungeon Siege.
Some are plain text, others are binary. The most interesting ones:

.PRS   -> Animation file. File magic is 'ANIM'. (BIN)
.SKRIT -> High-level script code; hand written. (TEXT)
.GAS   -> Misc config/metadata. Some are also skrit scripts. Most are probably auto-generated. (TEXT)
.LQD20 -> Unknown. Directory metadata for an editor perhaps? Always named "dir.lqd20". File magic is '.LQD'. (BIN)
.LNC   -> Unknown. Siege Node links? Related to Siege Nodes somehow... No apparent file magic/id. (BIN)
.BIK   -> Standard Bink video from Rad Game Tools: <http://www.radgametools.com/bnkdown.htm>

Those are all stored inside Tank archives, so you need
to first decompress a Tank to be able to see them.

----------------------------------
PRS animation data:
----------------------------------

This format contains animation data/keyframes needed to animate
the skeletons of an ASP model. Implementing an importer for it
should be easy, since there's a 3D Max script available with a functioning
implementation. See /source/thirdparty/gpg/siege_max/scripts/PRSImport.ms

No idea what "PRS" stands for...

----------------------------------
SKRIT/GAS:
----------------------------------

These are plain text files. The ones with ".skrit" extension are the game logic
scripts. The Skrit language uses a C-based syntax and is very well documented.

Check the following links for references:

The ".gas" files (Tanks store gas, get it :P) are miscellaneous configuration/metadata
files. Most seem auto-generated. Some contain skrit code inside. Gas files
store various types of metadata required by the game. ASP models and textures
are usually paired with a Gas file containing additional parameters.

----------------------------------
LNC (unknown):
----------------------------------

Usually the extension of a file named "siege_nodes.lnc", so more then likely
related to the Siege Nodes. They can be found inside the World/World1/MpWorld Tanks.

Some are pretty big 1+MB, some are just a few KB.

From a quick look in the Hex editor, nothing meaningful pops up.
Perhaps the data is compressed? Unlikely, since Tank archives are
already compressed, but that could explain the seemingly random patterns...

There are several blocks of consecutive zeros in them. Padding maybe?

----------------------------------
LQD20 (unknown):
----------------------------------

Always a file named "dir.lqd20" for every directory inside a Tank.
File magic is the 4CC '.LQD' (0x2E4C5144). Probably stands for "Liquid",
taking into account all the references to tanks, gas ...

Second DWORD seems to be always 0x06000100 (64542 LE).
Third DWORD is always zero.

Tiny binary files (a few KBs max). There's a string with the name of the parent
directory right at the end. Apparently zero terminated. No length prefix. Doesn't seem to be aligned either.

Some have filename strings in them and strings representing hexadecimal
constants (GUIDs probably). Example: "filename t_cf_fort-a1 0xab040201"

These were maybe used by the in-house editors/tools for file system indexing?
Seems superfluous for the game's asset manager since the Tank archives already
have a virtual file system with a list of all files/directories...

----------------------------------
BIK videos:
----------------------------------

Very standard compressed video format used by a lot of games in the late nineties.
Probably still used today, but I guess it lost space for more standard formats like MP4.
